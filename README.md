# uptrack

*increase your uptime, take control of your downtime*  

there are two modes, `uptime` and `downtime`  

in `uptime` mode, the app tracks what programs you are using the most (ex. chrome) and blocks sites of your choosing  

`downtime` modes disables tracking and undoes the site blocking  

you can see tracking stats as a pie/bar chart as well as download the `uptime` sessions as CSV file  

From your terminal:
```
npm install
npm start
```
